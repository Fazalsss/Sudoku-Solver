# Sudoku-Solver
In this project, I developed a robust Sudoku solver utilizing a backtracking algorithm to systematically fill in Sudoku boards. The solver is designed to efficiently find solutions for any valid Sudoku puzzle configuration.

# Features:

**Efficient Solver:** Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles systematically.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for inputting Sudoku boards and displaying solutions.

# Techniques and Skills:

1. **Python Programming:** Developed entirely in Python, utilizing its built-in data structures and control flow.

2. **Backtracking Algorithm:** Implemented a recursive backtracking function (solve_sudoku()) to explore and solve Sudoku boards step-by-step.

3. **CLI Input and Output:** Utilized Python's standard input/output functions for board input and solution display.

4. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Applied logical deduction and recursive strategies to solve complex Sudoku puzzles efficiently.


# To run the Sudoku Solver:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine. Verify with python --version in your terminal/command prompt.
   
2. Copy the provided Python code into a file (e.g., sudoku_solver.py).
  
3.  Customize the board variable with your Sudoku puzzle, where 0 represents empty cells.

4. Execute the Python file with python sudoku_solver.py.

5. The solver will display the original Sudoku board and its solution, if solvable.
